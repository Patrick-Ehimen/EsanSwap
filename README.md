# EsanSwap: A Multichain Decentralized Exchange Built with NextJs and Typescript and styled with Tailwindcss

EsanSwap is a cutting-edge decentralized trading protocol designed to empower users with a seamless experience for trading, earning, and owning cryptocurrencies across multiple chains. This project leverages the power of Figma for design and development, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive interface for our users. It is worth nothing that this project is still under development

## Project Overview

EsanSwap provides a robust platform for decentralized trading, featuring:

- **Multichain Support**: Trade seamlessly across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, thanks to our meticulous attention to detail in Figma.
- **Security and Transparency**: Built on blockchain technology, offering transparent and secure transactions.

## Using Figma in Project Development

Figma plays a pivotal role in the development process of EsanSwap. Here's an example of the design and how we utilize it:

### Design Phase

- **Wireframing and Prototyping**: We start by creating wireframes and prototypes in Figma to outline the application's structure and flow.
- **Component Library**: Establishing a comprehensive component library ensures consistency across the platform.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the platform is accessible and functional across devices through responsive design principles.

### Development Phase

- **Reference Material**: Developers refer to Figma designs for accurate implementation of UI elements and interactions.
- **Iterative Feedback Loop**: Continuous feedback between designers and developers helps refine the product based on real-world usage.
